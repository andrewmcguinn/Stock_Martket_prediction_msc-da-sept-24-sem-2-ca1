## 📌 Overview

Stock prediction is a **critical yet challenging task** due to the inherent volatility and complexity of financial markets.

This project integrates **Hadoop**, **Apache Spark**, and **deep learning models** to predict stock prices using historical data. Key contributions include:

* Hadoop for **distributed data storage**
* Apache Spark for **large-scale preprocessing** and **distributed computation**
* Deep learning using TensorFlow, including **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks**, capturing temporal dependencies in stock prices

The study analyzes over **10 years of historical stock data**, automatically downloaded using Python libraries for forecasting purposes.
